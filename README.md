# Professional README Generator
## Description
The motivation behind this project was to create an app via Node.js that will create a readme file after being fed user prompts. This will allow the user to ultimately save time writing the readme which will result in more time to work on the fun stuff!
I built this project in order to further my knowledge of Node.js and the power of the available package libraries that are available to programmers. In this case, the main package library used was Inquirer.
As stated earlier, this app saves time when it comes to writing - let’s be honest - sometimes tedious readme files by generating the bulk of the readme file for the user.
I learned more about the Node.js runtime environment while working on this project, and I look forward to exploring it more in the future and implementing it on future projects.

## Instructions {#instructions}
To use the readme generator app the user must be in the Node.js runtime environment, and must have Node.js and the associated packages installed before running. Node.js can be installed here: https://nodejs.org/en. Once installed the necessary packages can be installed by simply opening the command line and typing “node install”. Node.js will then search for the required packages that are shipped with the app, and if not found in the user’s local domain will download these from the internet. The entire process will only take a few seconds. From here, the user may execute the program by typing “index.js” in the terminal. The terminal must be pointing to the index.js file in the app.
## Contributions {#contributions}
This was an individual project with no outside collaboration.
If multiple collaborators are involved they will have their names and/or GitHub url listed here.
The third-party assets used include Node.js and Inquirer (https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), which is a dependency package for this app to run.
The primary tutorial used to design this project was the “Professional README Guide” blog article on The Full-Stack Blog (https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)
## Tests {#tests}
No tests have currently been run for this project apart from testing various inputs within the CLI to verify functionality on my local machine.
The user may test the functionality of the README Generator by typing various prompt answers into the command line once the app is executed.
